        <h2>Background</h2> 
        <p>Ontario has 36 conservation authorities which are divided by watersheds. They are responsible for those stations that fall within 
          their boundaries, with community members, volunteers and community organizations supporting the collection of data which would inform management decisions.
          The Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network (PWQMN) is the primary partnership for data collection and will be the
          focus of our solution.</p>
        <p>Data from the PWQMN provide vital information on the quality of stream water networks across 
          Ontario and covers a wide range of parameters. The current interface provided for displaying the data is designed to show
          active versus inactive stations on a map and give spatial context to people exploring its accompanying open source datasets but it
          does not go any further than that. The data collected through this program has the potential to play a role in engaging the 
          general public with water quality and protection issues. </p>
        <p>The lack of accessible and engaging information for the general public is a problem. The data that comes from programs like these is invaluable for
          the continued funding of existing programs as well as funding being allocated to new programs via public pressure on legislation. The image on the left 
          shows the current display for water stations that are part of the program. </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>The goal was to create a solution which educates and engages! This is an Esri Dashboard to display 
        the collected data along with a summarization of important water quality parameters. Alongside this 
        Dashboard will be an Esri StoryMap to communicate the reason the program exists as well as general 
        information about water quality monitoring programs</p>
