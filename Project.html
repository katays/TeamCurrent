                            <li> Data was downloaded from Ontario's Open data portal. The data sets chosen were:  one shp file

                            <li> The collection dataset had no data location attached so it was joined to the shp file of stations. After this was done

                    <h3> Step Two: Configuring Dashboard</h3>
                    <p class="project-page">We chose to use ArcGIS Dashboards to represent the data as it allowed the stations to be viewed on a clean interactive map,
                        similarly to the site for the provincial water quality monitoring network, with the addition to the user being able to see collected data from each station. 
                        As the StoryMap will be doing the job of giving background information on water quality monitoring issues, 
                        and this water quality monitoring program in particular, the intended focus of the Dashboard was conveying important themes in the 
                        data collected at individual stations. The elements of the dashboard can be split into two categories: Dynamic and Static. 
                    </p>  
                    
                    <div class="static">
                        <h4>Static</h4>
                        <p class="project-page pdash1">The static elements are: an indicator that shows the number of stations as well as the number of years that 
                            the program has been running (a) and a reference to recommended water levels (b). The indicator is a ready-to-use widget option 
                            within the Dashboard environment.The numerical values are referenced as the total count of distinct station numbers and the max number of total years for a station.
                            This way if records are added to the dataset it can be updated automatically (c). This was a useful discovery because it allows for automatic 
                            updating ,which may be the case where automation of collected data into the layer happens. The water level data was added in using the rich text widget, 
                            which is a simple text element that can be enhanced using html, but those enhancements weren't necessary for this dashboard.   
                        </p>

                        <p class="project-page pdash1"> The dynamic elements of the map make their change once the end user chooses a station. It will tell them how many years 
                            the station has been active, what types of collection has happened there and finally the data table of results
                            The Dashboard functionality that was used to make this happen was using layer actions. Layer actions allow you to choose 
                            widgets on the Dashboard to be targeted in different ways when a selection is made. The map was the main layer that was configured for layer 
                            actions and the indicator, pie chart and data table were the targets and the type of targeting that we used was filtering. 
                            When a station is chosen the data is filtered and the targets show the corresponding data.

                    <h3> Discoveries and Limitations</h3>   
                    <p class="project-page"> ArcGIS Dashboards gave us the ability to display the map alongside key data points that we thought fit into the overall 
                        theme. Integrating the map was simple as it was created in ArcGIS Online so it was readily available as an item to be 
                        added into the map. The other widgets were also easy enough to add to the layout and move around to suit our needs. The ease of
                        making configurations came at the expense of certain customizations. For example the header does not allow you to chose the text position, 
                        since we wanted it central we used the rich text option, but this mean in order to have the link out to the storymap and source data we still 
                        needed to have the header in there. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="project-page"> One discovery that was made but was not implemented for this dashboard was using selectors to allow users to filter the data 
                        themselves based on features. While we attempted to do this in different ways the ultimate problem was the way the data was put together 
                        in the excel was not ideal for using this feature. This feature would have allowed us to let people filter results by things like parameters or 
                        specific locations very easily. The benefit of this discovery is that if there is control over how the data is collected or extra time to sort 
                        and clean the data this would enhance the dashboard in a big way.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Last paragraph needs to stick with the slider ks -->
                    <p class="project-page"> 
                        The design of the Dashboard was centered around the user interacting with it when they click on a station.
                        Before this happens the Dashboard looks quite empty, especially in the dynamic column (a), but it was decided that this was okay because it was 
                        easily resolved by introducing interaction. A limitation we faced is that there is no way for the dashboard to default to this selection mode.
                        The interaction that fills the dashboard is dependent on the end-user knowing that they couldn't just click on the stations but 
                        instead first had to click the selection tool (b) and then make their selection. We tried to remedy this by including instructions for using
                         the select tool below the map (c), but it's acknowledged that it isn't the most intuitive user interface. A way to filter data without using the select tool 
                         would have been by filtering based on scale or zoom. Because the collection data was most relevant when looking at one specific station at a time versus a region 
                         we chose not to use it in our dashboard.

                    <p class="project-page">
                        A final limitation we experienced was in overall formatting of the rich text window. We had originally wanted to colour code some of our text to
                            match our pie charts as well as other adjustments to the text, and found the settings available to toggle incredibly limited in this 
                            regard. Colour blocking and enhanced layout design were unavailable and we really would have preferred a more dynamic solution in this application.

                        <div> <img src="Images/Theme.png" alt="Screenshot of Create Theme page">
                            <p class="project-page story1"> The first step in creating the story map was to create a custom theme using the Story Maps Create a Theme functionality. 
                                Creating a custom map theme allows for further cohesion and integration of the story map into the website.  In addition to this, by creating your own map theme
                            you are allowed more control and uniqueness </p>

                        <h3> Step 2: Create the flow </h3>
                    </div> 
                    <p class="project-page">The flow of the Story Map was centered around asking the big questions: Who, What, Where, When, How and most importantly, Why.
                        By asking, and answering the most basic questions, we are able to reach a wider audience and help them to understand not only water quality but why it's important
                        to care about what goes on in the water systems.

                        <img src="Images/AddInfo1_1.png" alt= "Screenshot of adding information icon" class="steph-pic">
                        <p class="project-page" id="stephs1"> Filling in the information was quite simple when it came time for it. Since the flow was set up, all that needed to be done 
                            was some plugging in. The Story Map functionality allows for several different formatting options, which can be accessed by hovering over the
                        area you wish to house the information and selecting the plus button that appears (see red box in the image (i)) </p>
                    </div> 
                    <div>
                        <img src="Images/AddInfo2_2.png" alt= "Screenshot of options to add to Story Map" class="steph-pic">
                        <p class="project-page" id="stephs2"> Image (ii) shows the options available. Because the theme was created prior to this, everything was predetermined. There were different
                            colours set for the different elements (Headings versus paragraphs, for example) so this allowed for formatting to be quite straightforward. Information needed to 
                            be inserted under its heading. Pictures were also inserted to help fully tell the story.  The more visuals there are, the more engaged readers can be.</p>

                    <h3>Discoveries and Limitations</h3>
                    <p class="project-page">Overall, creating the Story Map was simple, straightforward and enjoyable.  However, there are so formatting gaps that became frustrating.  For example, you are unable to
                        horizontally place buttons next to each other, they are only available to be vertically stacked. This takes up valuable space as the user works their way through the Story
                        as it makes it longer in length, unnecessarily.
